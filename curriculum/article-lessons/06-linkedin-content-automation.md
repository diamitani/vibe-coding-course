## What You'll Build

A content automation pipeline:

```
ChatGPT → 30-Day Content Calendar → Google Sheets → Make.com → LinkedIn Post
```

---

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Generate a 30-Day Content Calendar in ChatGPT

Prompt ChatGPT:

> "Generate a 30-day LinkedIn content calendar for [your niche/topic]. Each day should include: date, topic, post draft (within 2700 characters), 3-5 relevant hashtags. Format as a table."

Review and customize the output for your voice and audience.

### Step 2: Set Up Google Sheets

Create a folder in Google Drive (e.g., "Content Automation").

Create a spreadsheet with columns:

| Date | Topic | Post Draft | Hashtags | Status | Date Posted |
|------|-------|------------|----------|--------|-------------|

Paste your 30-day calendar into the sheet.

### Step 3: Build the Make.com Scenario

**Modules:**

1. **Schedule** — Set to run daily at 9:00 AM
2. **Google Sheets → Search Rows** — Find rows where Date = today AND Status is empty
3. **Filter** — Ensure content hasn't been posted yet
4. **LinkedIn → Create Post** — Connect LinkedIn account, map Post Draft to content
5. **Google Sheets → Update Row** — Set Status to "Posted" and Date Posted to `{{now}}`

### Step 4: Test and Refine

Run a manual test with a single row. Check:
- Does the post format correctly on LinkedIn?
- Is the character count under 2700?
- Are hashtags included?

### Step 5: Add AI Content Generation (Optional)

Instead of pre-writing all 30 posts, add an AI module between Sheets and LinkedIn:

```
Sheet (topic only) → ChatGPT/Claude → Generate Post → LinkedIn
```

This gives you fresh content daily with the latest context.

## Best Practices

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep posts under 2,700 characters | LinkedIn's hard limit |
| Use Search Rows with filters | Prevents duplicate posting |
| Test with multiple AI providers | Different tones for different content types |
| Always include a human review step | AI-generated content needs quality control |
| Schedule at consistent times | Build audience expectations |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Post too long | Add a Make.com text aggregator module to truncate |
| Wrong post format | Use LinkedIn's API doc to check allowed formats |
| Duplicate posts | Check your filter conditions |
| Authentication expired | Reconnect your LinkedIn account in Make.com |

## Key Takeaways

- A content automation pipeline removes the daily "what do I post?" friction
- Pre-generating a calendar gives you consistency; AI daily generation gives you freshness
- The review step remains critical — AI-generated content should never post without oversight
- This same pattern works for Twitter/X, Instagram, and other platforms

---

## Extension Ideas

- Multi-platform distribution (LinkedIn + Twitter + blog)
- Performance tracking (engagement metrics back to the sheet)
- A/B testing different post styles
- Comment reply automation for engagement
- Content repurposing (long-form → thread → post → carousel)
